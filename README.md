#### 'copy' artifacts are a computer issue not an app issue

### 1. Interactive Map

Allows the user to pan and zoom at will. Allows the questions from the database to be displayed on the map, the user to be tracked on mobile and the coordinates to be found when the user clicks on the map.

### 2. Question Form

All question boxes must be filled out for a submission to be successfully recorded. The coordinates can be entered manually or by clicking in the map.

### 3. Side Menu

*	Home – refreshes the page and resets extent.
*	Location tracker – finds the users location. Mobile only.
*	Question Finder – load the questions from the database to the map.
*	Submit Question – add markers from the database to the map.
*	Clear Question – Remove values from the question form.

### 4. Drop Down Menu

The drop-down menu has links to the user guide, technical guide and my personal GitHub.
